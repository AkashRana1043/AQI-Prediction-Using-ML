# Air Quality Index Prediction by [Akash Rana(2311981043), Akriti Sharma(2311981046), Aaditya Kapruwan(2311981037)]
This project was initially created by [Krishna Naik]. Our team modified and enhanced it as part of our final project.
This project uses machine learning models to predict air quality index (AQI) levels based on various features like temperature, humidity, etc.
